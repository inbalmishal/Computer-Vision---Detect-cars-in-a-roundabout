# Computer-Vision---Detect-cars-in-a-roundabout
This project deals with identification and tracking of moving cars in a roundabout. In the project, each car is identified and given an identification number.
The project contains three main parts: stabilizing the video of the cars in the square, identifying the contours of these cars and tracking new cars entering the frame in front of cars coming out of the frame.

The files in this repository:
- finalProject - The notebook of the code.
- P1_roundabout - The original video of the cars in the square.
- final_detection - The project result. If you run the code in "finalProject" this video will be created for you.
